# Cryptocurrencies


Overview
The purpose of the following analysis is to analyze the traded cryptocurrencies by group and feature, using unsupervised machine learning techniques. 
The methods below were utilized to conduct the analysis:
•	Preprocessing the Data for PCA
•	Reducing the Data Dimensions using PCA
•	Clustering the Cryptocurrencies using K-means
•	Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results


Results

Use of unsupervised machine learning to get clusters of the cryptocurrencies. The following elbow curve was created using the K-Means method.(Elbow Curve)

Visualization #2
The following 2D scatter plot with clusters was achieved using the PCA Algorithm to reduce the crypto currencies dimensions.
Note: The outliers can also be identified in class 2 &3

Summary
Based on the information we were able to obtain using the above unsupervised learning techniques, there’s 532 tradable cryptocurrencies. We can identify the most traded by class; most of the cryptocurrencies belong to classes 1 &2.
